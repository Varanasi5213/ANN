# Cifar-10
**Description**
>Training Cifar-10 on various CNN networks. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
**Work Details**
1. _Cifar_10_CNN.ipynb_ and _Cifar_10_CNN2.ipynb_ have custom models to train on Cifar-10.
2. _Cifar_10_CNN2.ipynb_ has non-linear architecture and has better accuracy than linear architecture _Cifar_10_CNN.ipynb_.
3. _cifar-10.ipynb_ is transfer learning on the VGG network.
